# Nutrition-Food-Insight-Analysis-Competition

This notebook is a DataCamp competition. You can find in the link: https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/9d9933bf-ba27-44e3-a6e5-b0a96e707d82.

## The challenge
Create a report that covers the following:
- Which fruit has the highest vitamin C content? What are some other sources of vitamin C?
- Describe the relationship between the calories and water content of a food item.
- What are the possible drawbacks of a zero-carb diet? What could be the drawbacks of a very high-protein diet?
- A gram of fat has around 9 kilocalories, and a gram of protein and a gram of carbohydrate contain 4 kilocalories each. Fit a linear model to test whether these estimates agree with the data.
- Analyze the errors of your linear model to see what could be the hidden sources of calories in food.

## The data
The source nutrition data of the competition was taken from USDA's FoodData Central website.
This data contains the calorie content of 7,793 common foods, as well as their nutritional composition. Each row represents one food item, and nutritional values are based on a 100g serving. Here is a description of the columns:
- FDC_ID: A unique identifier for each food item in the database.
- Item: The name or description of the food product.
- Category: The category or classification of the food item, such as "Baked Products" or "Vegetables and Vegetable Products".
- Calories: The energy content of the food, presented in kilocalories (kcal).
- Protein: The protein content of the food, measured in grams.
- Carbohydrate: The carbohydrate content of the food, measured in grams.
- Total fat: The total fat content of the food, measured in grams.
- Cholesterol: The cholesterol content of the food, measured in milligrams.
- Fiber: The dietary fiber content of the food, measured in grams.
- Water: The water content of the food, measured in grams.
- Alcohol: The alcohol content of the food (if any), measured in grams.
- Vitamin C: The Vitamin C content of the food, measured in milligrams.
